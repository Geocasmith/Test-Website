This is my attempt at recreating the figma file https://www.figma.com/file/GOdW5HyfB4g6nZJ0aQ2b2q/Dev-Test-v1?node-id=209%3A3

To Run 
1. Clone project
2. Open the ide terminal and enter the home-page directory using cd home-page
3. Run "npm install && npm run start"
4. React will open the page in a new tab
